# intro to ml-hw

A repository containing my work and final project for ECGR-4105 at UNCC. Feel free to contact me or contribute to the final project. I'm excited to see how far I can take it! 

## Final Project 

See [README.MD](https://github.com/Anu78/intro-to-ml-hw/blob/main/project/README.md) for more information. Essentially, the goal is to make a GeoGuessr model that identifies the longitude/latitude of an image within 50 miles more than 70% of the time.
